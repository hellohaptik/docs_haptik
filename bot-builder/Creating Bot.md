## Create a New Bot

Time to get started! 

The first step in the process of creating a bot is to configure your bot's basic details. Navigate to the Mogambo homepage and click on the "Create a new bot" button, located in the upper right hand corner of the page:

The following pop-up will appear:

Fill the bot details according to the instructions given here:

- **Name your bot**: Give your bot a name. Keep it relevant to the main function of your bot to make it easier to find in the future!
- **Test Business**: To understand what a business is, read about how we organize bots on Mogambo HERE. In short, a business is basically a group of bots that you can deploy together across various partners. So in this dropdown menu, assign the most appropriate business to this bot. 
- **Owner**: Just like businesses, owners are a component of the Mogambo bot organizing framework. To read about the role of owners in the organizational hierarchy, jump HERE. *Note* that "owner" is synonymous with "partner". In short, an owner is Mogambo's largest unit of organization, and is a deployment of multiple businesses that can be deployed in multiple locations. 

You may also upload a new bot if you have one already created. 

Click "Ok" to go on to the next page, where you'll be prompted to input the stories and sub-stories that will make up your conversation flow.
