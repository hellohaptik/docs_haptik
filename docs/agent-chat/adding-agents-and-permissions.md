title: Adding Agents & Permissions
---

## Features
All our functionalities are linked to a feature, if the feature is allocated to a user, the functionality is accessible.

## Permission Groups

A combination of these features is what we term as 'Permission Groups'

Agents can be assigned these 'Permission Groups' via the haptik administrator. By default we have two configured '**Permission Groups**' for clients, namely:

### Enterprise Chat Assistant

	- can receive chats
	- can mark chats as complete/waiting for user
	- can report an abusive/troll user
	- can logout

### Enterprise Chat Assistant TL

	- can receive chats
	- can access business overwise
	- can modify/create a team
	- can add/edit chat disposition settings
	- can review chats of agents
	- can assign a chat to an agent or a team
	- can claim chats for himself
	- can logout

>  While these are the default set of permission groups available, if a client wishes to have these features segregated differently, they can do so.


### Features that can be allocated

These features could be added to a client specific permission group, if requested or required.

	- can add canned responses (predefined replies that agents could use)
	- can add external tools
	- will receive daily expert performance csv via mail

<!-- TODO: add a link to permission group editing here -->

Agents can access user details on `My Chats` i.e. in the user_info section. A special permission `admin_view_chat_link_user_details` is needed for an agent to view information passed on user creation. Example of this would be when the agents have user's "Booking ID" in a hotel-booking IVA. We display this information to agents with the existing user_info section fields like Name, Email, Number, etc.

After clicking on save you will be redirected to a page where you can upload the agents profile picture.

>  This profile picture along with the display name value appears on our SDK's when an agent joins a conversation with a user.

You can choose to skip the above step for later.

**Note:** Initial image will be optionally uploaded by the lead, updating the image is handled directly from individual agent profile pages.

#### Option 2: Using profile page

An agent can access his user profile page by simply clicking on 'User Profile' as in below screenshot of our live chat tool.
