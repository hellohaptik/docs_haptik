    Ex: We added an external url (https://material.io/design/) which should appear
    for Flight Hindi Voice Business as "Test External Link".

- Now, click "*Add External Tool*", to land on the screen below. Here, you enter the following details:
        1. Business: Select your unique business name. (will be available in dropdown)
        2. Partner: Select your unique partner name. (will be available in dropdown)
        3. Task: Can be ignored, and left blank
        4. Tool Name: Can be any string (this is what will apear to the agents)
        5. URL: An external link to your tool
        6. Tick: "Link" or "Tool"
        7. Hit Submit

![add_external_tool](assets/add_external_tool.png)

- On success, your tool will now appear for all agents allocated to your business.

![agent_view_tool](assets/agent_view_tool.png)

- Simply click on the tool, and the URL will open on the RHS

![agent_view_tool_url](assets/agent_view_tool_url.png)

## Important Design Note

- The RHS section, where the tool loads is restricted to exactly 26% of the page ~ 360px in width in most cases.
- Please make sure that the tool is responsive to all required screen resolutions

## Important Tech Note

- An external tool appears for a business, if a user wishes to use the same tool across multiple businesses, they can do so by adding a the same entry for the other businesses.

- Please make sure your `X-Frame-Options` is set to allow our host, so that your tool can open within our iframe.

```json
Header set X-Frame-Options "allow-from https://staging.hellohaptik.com"
```
