You can think of this *Businesses* page being navigated from left to right in 3 sections. First you select a Business, then you select the chat list (ex: BOT, Queued). And then you could choose to access a chat detail view in third section.

## Section 1: List of businesses

This section lists the businesses against 2 metrics

1. Total Live chats: As the name suggests, you get the count of live chats for this business at any instant.
2. Delayed chats: This gives you the number of *Delayed chats* for a business. When you create a *Team* for any business, you set the time value for which a chat is supposed to be considered delayed.

       Tip: Delayed chat time can be different for any team in a business. 
       
You can click on any business in this section, to render the chats for it, in the next section.

## Section 2: Chat lists

This section is divided into 5 sub-sections -

1. BOT
2. Queue
3. Active
4. Waiting for User
5. Completed Chats

![Chat lists](assets/businesses_chats_sub_sections.png)

Within a selected sub-section view, you can filter by Team or Assignee (both Assigned and Unassigned chats).

    Tip: You can also filter and Chats list to show only new users or to show only delayed chats.
    
For any chat in a list view, you can click the *Reassign chat* view to reassign a specific chat to a Team or an Agent.
