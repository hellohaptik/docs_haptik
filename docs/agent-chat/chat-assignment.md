## A restaurant analogy

### The setting

In our restaurant, there are only two kind of people involved in the operation:
 - Chefs who are responsible for receiving the customers and taking their order, preparing the meal, and serving it.
 - Guests who come in and sit down at the table in the restaurant and wait to be attended to.

Obviously, due to COVID-19, the guest's don't actually eat at the restaurant.
They just sit, physically distancing from each other, waiting for their food to be prepared.
Once a chef returns with their meal, they pick it up and leave the restaurant.

# FAQs

 - What are the factors do you consider to assign chats?

   This question is too vague 

 - Would your assignment cater to high traffic scenarios?
 - Say I had 5 agents and I always see the efficiency is lost as I have seen chats going to 1 agent only, why is that?

 - How does your assignment help in reducing my SLAs (SLA could be FRT or Resolution time specific)
 - To assign the most recent chat to agents instead of the longest queued chat.
 - Chat assignment based on the User Online Status. Prioritize the chats to be assigned where the user is online on the platform.
