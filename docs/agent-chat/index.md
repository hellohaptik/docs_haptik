Chat Solutions at Haptik can be powered entirely by Artificial Intelligence (AI) or by a combination of AI and Chat Agents. We have built a *Live Chat* tool for it. This tool is created for operationally managing user chats.

## Using *Live Chat*

To use this tool, users are to be created with a specific set of permissions. The users can then start monitoring and taking daily chats on their business. *Live Chat* tool has the same capabilities of the AI along with additional functionalities such as chat flow analytics, assignment of chats by managers etc.

## Main components

There are three sections in this tool: 

1. My Chats
2. Businesses
3. Teams

You will read about the above concepts in subsequent sections.

*My Chats* is a section, where you converse with users i.e. agents receive and send messages. 

    Tip: In case a bot is unable to respond to a query, which is outside the chat flow, 
    the chat is handed over to a chat agent. 

Chat flows are designed to guide the user through a specific problem and to ensure the best experience for all users. And our *Live Chat* tool helps connect users to agents for answering their queries. 

    Tip: "Agents" are people who chat with users on the tool.

*Businesses* and *Teams* are sections to analyse your business/team data and configure respective settings for incoming chats.
