You can launch the messaging activity by using the following method. Ask
Haptik for mapping of business to their unique name which you may then
utilize in SDK

```java
// Opens messaging/chat view of specified channel
Router.launchChannel(Context context, String businessViaName);
```

You can launch the channel and send a custom message to the bot
automatically by calling the following method

```java
Router.launchChannelWithCustomMessage(Context, String businessViaName, String message, String source, boolean displayInChat);
```
