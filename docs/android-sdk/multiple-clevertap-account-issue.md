## Multiple CleverTap Account Issue

If you are not using the Haptik SDK with CleverTap Multiinstance SDK and
if you're already using `CleverTap` SDK in your app and sending analytic
events then there might be potential issue where `CleverTap` can't
support two different accounts' events getting fired from one app.

In this case, don't enable CleverTap functionality for Haptik SDK.
