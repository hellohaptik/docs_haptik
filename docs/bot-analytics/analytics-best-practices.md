**Intelligent Analytics** tool helps you build an experience that is

1. Adaptable
2. Responsive
3. Actionable

## Adaptability

While your bot is built for certain actions, you can add to the existing set of user intents. You get actionable insights from [Story analysis](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-analytics/story-analysis).

## Responsiveness

The [Message analysis](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-analytics/using-message-analysis) section can be used to figure the conversations where the IVA didn't work and how could we optimise our IVA further. You can use a series of filters and also export the messages in a CSV for analysis.

## Actionable insights

We provide the user reviews/ratings to evaluate the IVA performance. The primary goal of this tool is to help you update or modify the IVA with time.

On a daily basis, you can analyse the user messages or bot responses on the IVA. Read on further to understand each component and datapoint that could matter to you.
