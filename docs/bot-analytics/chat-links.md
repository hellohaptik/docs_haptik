**What are chat links?**

Chat links are the conversation is between the user and the bot or between user and a live agent, chat links can be shared across with anyone. 
There are scenarios where we need to analyse the conversation, chat links are extremely useful in this case. 

## **What all information chat links contain?**

Chat links have - 
* All conversations between the user and the bot/agent.
* User details such as their name, email and the information which you have collected in the bot.
* The timestamps at which the messages were exchanged between user and the bot/agent.

Along with information, for ease of action, there are two buttons, namely, **Previous Conversation** and **Next Conversation** to toggle between multiple conversations of the user.
