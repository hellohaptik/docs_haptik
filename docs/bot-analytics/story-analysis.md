title: Story Analysis
---

You must already know that *Stories* are sub-components within a created bot. In our analytics tool, you can click on "*Story Analysis*" to analyse any bot's performance on a sub-story level.

Start by selecting a specific business and the custom date range. And then you can see a *data table* and *donut chart(s)*. 

### Data table

You get a list of all sub-stories. And you can also expand each sub-story to see all nodes in a sub-story. For each sub-story and node, we get the following metrics:

1. Conversations
  *This column gives you the total number of user conversations on a sub-story or node.*

2. Automation
  *Automation percent is a value that tells you the bot's impact. A high automation percentage implies that the bot is successful in handling most queries by itself.* 
         
    Ex 1: 88% automation
    Ex 2: 24% automation
    
    In above Example 2, the bot wasn't successfully able to complete chats on its own 
    i.e. help respond to users queries.
  
3. Users
  *The total count of users on a sub-story or node will help you gauge traction and engagement from one node to another.*
  
4. Analyse
  *You can click the "Analyse" icon to land in the Message analysis section. Here, you could dive deeper into the conversations (chat flow).*

### Donut charts

These donut chart graphs help visualise data on nodes and sub-stories.

**Total Conversations**

Click *View Total Conversations* to get a graphical breakup of conversations per sub-story/node. 

    1. To expand the donut chart for a particular sub-story, click a sub-story area on chart. 
    2. On click, you get the node-wise donut graph below. This graph changes as you click on 
    another sub-story on the top donut chart.
