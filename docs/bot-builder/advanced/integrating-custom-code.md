title: Integrating Custom Code
---

## Node Integrations
Once a particular node has been detected and the mandatory entities have been collected, these entities can be given to custom code to execute your own business logic.

There are 2 different ways to execute this business logic.

### API Functions

_This is internal to Haptik Developers_

### Webhooks

A node can be configured to call a webhook once the required entities have been collected.

To deploy a live webhook that can receive webhook events, your code must be hosted on a public HTTP server that has the following:

- A Valid SSL Certificate
- An open port that accepts `GET` and `POST` requests

There are two ways to use webhooks to integrate external code in your bot. The two ways are:

#### 1. Relative URLs

In the first method, you can set a common base URL for the bot. And then you can add relative paths in the node where the integration is required. This method allows you to set two base URLs, one for the test environment and one for the production environment.

Having environment specific base URLs allows you to easily test your bot with code from different environments. Also because only the production base URL will be used in production, this helps you avoid issues of accidentally having a production bot linked to non production code.

In your test environment you can configure which environment's base URL to use. However, in production only the production environment's base URL will be used. This is to ensure that the bots in production are only referring to production code.


##### Setting up base URL
You can set the environment specific base URLs while creating the bot as shown below.

1. Click on Create Bot
2. Fill details and scroll down to the `Bot deployment environment` section.
3. Enter the environment specific base URLs.

![environment specific base URL for new bots](assets/integrating_custom_code_env_base_url_new_bot.png)


For existing bots you can set or update these URLs by using the `edit bot` option from the top menubar in the bot builder tool.

![environment specific base URL edit bot](assets/integrating_custom_code_env_base_url_edit_bot.gif)

##### Adding integration endpoint

1. Click on node on which you want to add integration function
2. Select Integration
3. Select API and put API endpoint like shown in image

![adding integration endpoint](assets/integrating_custom_code_endpoint.png)

***Note***: The endpoint uses the environemnt specific base URL of the bot. You can see the URL in the label of the textbox.

#### 2. Override base URLs and use absolute URLs
The second method is to use absolute URLs. There might be times where you want to use an API endpoint on a domain which is different from the base URL. In such cases you can override the base URL as shown below. Just select the override base URL option and enter the full URL including the path in the text box.

**Request Method**

POST

**Request Headers**

| Header          | Description                                                  |

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**1. node** - Unique system name of the calling node

> **Nodes** are the interlinked building blocks of a bot. Each node acts like a gatekeeper who detects user inputs, sends out appropriate responses, and directs users to the next node. They are the points where conversation converges or diverges basis the information users input to the bot. Nodes are comprised of several important sub-components, which house important pieces of information. [Read More](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/creating-nodes#what-is-a-node)

**2. entities** - The entities dictionary will have a key for each entity that is detected e.g. movie_name, venue, phone_number, etc. The value for each entity is a list of dictionary as shown below.

> **Entities**: An entity represents the set of values from which a user’s response must come in order for that user to progress onwards in a conversation. Depending on the context of the conversation, the required response can either be a single value or limited group of specific values from the entity, or any value from within the entity. Entities are always added in connection with the bot’s query the required response is associated with, so that they may detect whether the required response was given. [Read More](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/entities)

**3. event** - event type e.g. API_INTEGRATION

**4. user** - Dictionary containing user data

**5. conversation_no** - Identifier for the current conversation of the user with this Business

**6. conversation_data** - Conversation data stores the current context of the conversation.Things like insurance number or product id which are the current scope of the conversation will go under conversation data. 

This data will be stored in redis with expiry time of 3 hours.


**7. permanent_user_data** -  Permanent data stores user's data like address, PAN number, Aadhar number which are independent of the current context of the bot conversation.

Permanent user data will be available across bots and businesses as long as the underlying user is the same in the database. 

> Conversation data and permanent user data can be set from the backend as well.

**entity output format**

```json
[
    {
        "entity_value": entity_value,
        "detection": detection_method,
        "original_text": original_text
    }
]
```

Consider the following example for detailed explanation:

"I want to order from mcd"

- entity_value: This will store the value of entity (i.e entity value) that is detected. For example, Mc’Donalds.
- detection: This will store how the entity is detected i.e. whether from message, structured value or fallback value.
- original_text: This will store the actual value that is detected. For example, mcd.

**Response Parameters**

A `200 OK` HTTP Response must be sent back to the Haptik Servers, Failing which a bot break response will be sent to the user. Webhook response must be sent in 30 seconds or less, failing which a bot break response will be sent to the user.
The following additional fields can be specified by the Webhook to control behaviour of the bot and send messages to the user.

```json
{
    "response": [
        "message1",
        "message2",
        ....
    ],
    "status": True/False,
    "conversation_data": {}, // Optional
    "permanent_user_data": {} // Optional
}
```

> conversation_data and permanent_user_data keys are only required if you want to update the conversation and permanent user data from the backend

| Name     | Type    | Description                                                  |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| response | array   | List of messages to be sent to the user                      |
| status   | boolean | If status is True, then the decorator will assign the response to success_response. If status is False, then the decorator will assign the response to failure_response |

**status** - Depending on whether the node is an end node or not, the True/False flag can affect the status of the chat.

> If the node is an **end node** and if the integration response returns **status True**, then the chat will be **moved to complete state.**
>
> If the node is an **end node** and if the integration response returns **status False**, then the chat will remain in **Bot state**.
>
> If the node is **not an end node**, then the chat **remains in Bot state** after sending the response irrespective of the status.

**response** -Response will be array of string(s) or hsl(haptik specific language).

for example:

1. Response with single line

   ```python
   {
       "status": True,
       "response": ["phone number seems invalid, please try again"]
   }
   ```

2. Response with multi-line
    ```python
    {
        "status": True,
        "response": ["phone number seems invalid", "please try again"]
    }
    ```

3. Response for Multi-Lingual Bot
    ```python
    language_code = request_body['user']['language_code'] #assuming request_body contains post-data
    if  language_code == 'en':
      message = ["phone number seems invalid, please try again"]
    elif language_code == 'hi':
      message = ["फ़ोन नंबर अमान्य लगता है, कृपया पुनः प्रयास करें"]
    else:
      message = <Any Message as per use case>

   {
      "status": True,
      "response": message # One we created above from conditional logic^^
   }
    ```

4. Response with advanced UI elements [for more detail read here](https://haptik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bot-builder-advanced/message-elements.html)

![Bot response with advanced UI elements](/assets/advanced-ui-element.png)


 ```json
   {
     "status": true,
     "response": [
       '{
         "text": "COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT; CBC",
         "type": "BUTTON",
         "data": {
           "items": [
             {
               "actionable_text": "View Price",
               "location_required": false,
               "is_default": 0,
               "uri": "LAUNCH_CHANNEL",
               "type": "TEXT_ONLY",
               "payload": {
                 "gogo_message": "",
                 "message": "I want to check the price of this test"
               }
             },
             {
               "actionable_text": "View Details",
               "location_required": false,
               "is_default": 0,
               "uri": "LINK",
               "type": "APP_ACTION",
               "payload": {
                 "url": "XYZ.COM",
                 "gogo_message": ""
               }
             }
           ]
         },
         "isNew": false
       }'
     ]
   }
   ```


5. Response When conversation and permanent user data needs to be updated
    ```python
    {
        "status": True,
        "response": ["phone number seems invalid", "please try again"],
        "conversation_data": {
          "insurance_no": "CDQP12324",
          "payment_mode": "COD" 
        },
        "permanent_user_data": {
          "phone_number": 8826755986,
          "date_of_birth": "21/07/1995"
        },
    }
    ```

>The total size of conversation_data and permanent_user_data cannot be more than 500 characters

As per our pipeline, if there is no response at specific stages, then it will be treated as a Botbreak scenario. So if your Bot Says section on Mogambo doesn't have any response or the integration function doesn't return any response, then a Botbreak message will be sent or the chat will be moved to Pending state depending on whether Human assistance is disabled or enabled respectively.

> So if human_assistance is OFF on business manager => Botbreak message will be sent.
>
> If human_assistance is ON on business manager => Chat will be moved to pending and assigned to an agent.

**Validate Webhook**

The HTTP request will contain an X-Hub-Signature header which contains the SHA1 signature of the request payload, using the secret_key entered for the node, and prefixed with sha1=. Your API can verify this signature to validate the integrity and origin of the payload.

**Sample python code for webhook**

### Custom Code

A node can also be configured to execute custom code once the required entities have been collected.

To be able to do so, you can use the in-built code editor in Mogambo or paste Python3.6 specific code into the editor and save.

The only requirement is, the code should follow the below format. If any syntax errors or exceptions are raised by the main function, this will result in a botBreak message.

```python

#### Error Response

If there is any error in the Headers or the Request body, then the Error message will be returned in a JSON as shown below:

```json
{
  "error_message": "user has not sent a message"
}
```

Here is a list of some possible error messages
|Error Message|Details|
--------------|-------|
|invalid client_id|Incorrect client-id is passed in the headers
|invalid token|The Authorization token provided is incorrect
|user_name missing|The user_name is not provided in the request params
|business_id missing|The business_id is not provided in the request params
|conversation_no missing|The conversation_no is not provided in the request params
|invalid user_name|The user_name provided is not valid for the Partner
|user has not sent a message|The user has not had any chat on that Business


#### Sample CURL command

```
curl -X POST \
  https://<base-url>/integration/external/v1.0/get_chat_history/?user_name=<user_name>
  &conversation_no=<conversation_no>&business_id=<business_id>&limit=<limit> \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
  -H 'client-id: <CLIENT_ID>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
}
```

## Best Practices

**1. Assign Chat to Agent** In some scenarios, where integration response fails or some unknown exception occurs then instead of sending bot break message we can also directly assign chat to an agent for better user experience. <Coming Soon>

**2.Handle textual content** - Everytime we want to change bot's response, a code change is required. To avoid that pain, we can use **key value stores**. Any person with zero to little tech knowledge can change bot response from key value store (with GUI) by updating the message copy corresponding to that unique message key or ID. This message key can be shared with the developer and fetch the response using that key.

**3. HSLs**  - Haptik defines a superset of UI elements that are available across multiple platforms. These UI elements are then converted to their platform equivalent (js-sdk, android, ios, facebook-messenger, etc..) if they are not available on that specific platform. Eg. Forms are converted to quick replies on the Facebook platform and collected over free form. [for more detail read here](https://docs.haptik.ai/hsl/)
