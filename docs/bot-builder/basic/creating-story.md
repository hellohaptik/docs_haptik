#### Components of a Story Flow

Once you've configured your bot, you'll need to set up the stories and sub-stories that make up your chat flow. We've given a description of these units in Bot Hierarchy, but you can also see the Designing Bots section for more details about the role of stories and sub-stories in the creation of chatflows.

- **Stories** are chatflows that usually align with the overall goals of the chatbot. For example, a trip aggregator website wants to build a chatbot with the goal of helping users:

  - Book flights
  - Find and book hotels
  - Make restaurant reservations

  Each of these major tasks would be classified as a story.

- **Sub-stories** are the smaller tasks that help accomplish the broader story goals. Continuing our trip aggregator example from above, the sub-stories within the "Find and book hotels" story could include:

  - Collect user preferences (location, amenities, dates, etc.) for hotel match
  - Hotel booking
  - Booking payment
  - Information about hotel aggregator's other services

You can use the framework of stories and sub-stories as a skeleton for building out the chat flows for your entire bot. One important thing to remember is that while sub-stories may be linked, stories may not.

When you are done creating all the sub-stories your conversation requires, click "Add Node" under the substory you want to start building in.
