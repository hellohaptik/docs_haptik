## Move a chat to pending

This API allows you to move chats for a Bot to an Agent via a `POST` request to the Haptik Platform.

Example URL: `https://<base-url>/integration/external/v1.0/send_chat_to_agent/`

> Note: The `base-url` will be provided by Haptik at the time of integration.


#### Headers

```
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
client-id: <CLIENT_ID>
Content-Type: application/json
```

- Authorization - The Authorization header of each HTTP request should be “Bearer” followed by the token which will be provided by Haptik. This token needs to be updated for your Partner under CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN field.
- client-id - The client id for your account which will be provided by Haptik
- Content-Type - application/json

#### Request

```json
{
    "team_name": "<Name of the team>",
    "user_name": "<haptik user name>",
    "business_id": "<business_id>",
    "countdown": "<time_in_seconds>"
}
```

- user_name (string): Identifier for the User provided by Haptik when invoking the Integration API
- business_id (number): This is a numeric identifier for the channel where the User is messaging
- team_name (string): Name of the team to which the chat is to be assigned. Can be fetched from the Teams page of Agent Chat Tool.
- countdown (number): If value is set to 5, then after 5 seconds chat will be moved to the queue. Otherwise, the chat will be moved to the queue after 10 seconds (default), value can be from range 5 to 10 seconds.



#### Response

A successful request to the API will return a `200` status code with a JSON response object.

```json
{
    "success": true
}
```
- success: Indicates if the API was a success or failure

#### Error Response

If there is any error in the Headers or the Request body, then the Error message will be returned in a JSON as shown below:

## FAQ Node Creation APIs for KMS
We have many clients who need FAQ bots. Every time when we want to change the content of these FAQs (Q&As), a new CSV with Node name, Question and Answer in a defined format needs to be uploaded. (Format given below)

We have developed an API that can be integrated with the client KMS(Knowledge Management Systems) via any intermediate layer and every time when data gets changed in KMS, it should call this API to keep data in sync with the Haptik systems.

This API allows you to create/update/delete faq nodes via a `POST` request to Haptik Platform. 

> Note: The `base-url` will be provided by Haptik at the time of integration.

FAQ Node creation process API consists of two parts:
1. **Submit the CSV**: To handle the large csv files, this API takes the request data and after validation submit it to celery worker and returns the `task id`, which executes the task asynchronously.

2. **Polling API** to fetch the status of submitted `task id`

Example URL: `https://<base-url>/mogambo_api/nodes/faq/create/`

![CSV Format](assets/faq_node_csv_format.png)

```
1. node_name: Name of the node, node name should be unique

2. Question(User Says): Independent Responses under User Says to detect this FAQ node. Multiple user says for single node can be passed as pipe(|) separated values(refer the sample row in image above)

3. answer(bot says): A node can have single or multiple bot says, to pass multiple bot says use `<m>` tag as delimiter
```

#### Headers

```
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
client-id: <CLIENT_ID>
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

- Authorization - The Authorization header of each HTTP request should be “Bearer” followed by the token which will be provided by Haptik. This token needs to be updated for your Partner under CLIENT_AUTH_TOKEN field.
- client-id - The client id for your account which will be provided by Haptik
- Content-Type - multipart/form-data

#### Request Body

```form-data
"domain_name": "<Name of the Domain/Bot>",
"csv_file": filename.csv,
```

#### Response

A successful request to the API will return a `200` status code with a JSON response object.

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "body": {
        "task_id": "fe139ce5-f4c3-4383-bacb-64a546cb0b6c"
    },
    "error": "",
    "meta": {}
}
```

- success flag Indicates if the API was a success or failure
- task_id: Job id for the submitted task

#### Error Response

If there is any error in the Headers or the Request body, then the Error message will be returned in a JSON as shown below:

```json
{
  "error_message": "invalid doman"
}
```

| Error Code | Error Message|
|----------|:-------------:|
| 401 | Unauthorized Access or invalid token|
| 400 | Invalid or bad request body   |
| 403 | Access Forbidden |

#### Sample Curl Command to submit csv file and get job id
```
curl -X POST \
  https://<base-url>/mogambo_api/nodes/faq/create/ \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -H 'client-id: <client-id>' \
  -H 'content-type: multipart/form-data; 
  -F 'domain_name=<domain_name>' \
  -F csv_file=@filename.csv
```

> Note: This API follows the upsert [UPDATE and INSERT] behaviour i.e. every time when new CSV gets uploaded it makes the existing FAQ nodes for that domain inactive, creates new nodes for the rows mentioned in the CSV and updates Nodes with same names with the new User Says and Bot Says from the CSV. 

## Polling API to fetch submitted task Status

This API allows you to see the status of submitted task id
via a `GET` request to Haptik Platform. 

Example URL: `https://<base-url>/mogambo_api/nodes/faq/create/status/<task_id>/`

> task_id: Id of task which gets created when we submit csv to node creation api

#### Headers
```
Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>
client-id: <CLIENT_ID>
```

#### Response
A successful request to the API will return a `200` status code with a JSON response object.

```json
{
    "success": true,
    "body": {
        "status": "all nodes has been created successfully"
    },
    "error": "",
    "meta": {}
}
```
- success flag Indicates if the API was a success or failure


#### Sample Curl Command to get the task status

```
curl -X GET \
  https://<base-url>/mogambo_api/nodes/faq/create/status/<task_id>/ \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>' \
  -H 'client-id: <CLIENT ID>' \
```

#### Possible Statuses:

**Error/Exception**: shows the exception/error occured for the last node and stops the execution

**In Progress**: Node Creation is in progress

**Success**: Nodes has been created successfully

## Best Practices

**1. Assign Chat to Agent** In some scenarios, where integration response fails or some unknown exception occurs then instead of sending bot break message we can also directly assign chat to an agent for better user experience. <Coming Soon>

**2.Handle textual content** - Everytime we want to change bot's response, a code change is required. To avoid that pain, we can use **key value stores**. Any person with zero to little tech knowledge can change bot response from key value store (with GUI) by updating the message copy corresponding to that unique message key or ID. This message key can be shared with the developer and fetch the response using that key.

**3. HSLs**  - Haptik defines a superset of UI elements that are available across multiple platforms. These UI elements are then converted to their platform equivalent (js-sdk, android, ios, facebook-messenger, etc..) if they are not available on that specific platform. Eg. Forms are converted to quick replies on the Facebook platform and collected over free form. [for more detail read here](https://docs.haptik.ai/hsl/)
