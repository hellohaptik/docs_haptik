We all need support while using a product. When a user has issues, they can reach out to our support system to get their resolution. The issues could be of varied types from product usage, to technical support to other things.

**So, how do we reach out to Haptik Support?**
Everyone can reach out to Haptikâ€™s Support by using either of this -
- Dropping a mail to **support@haptik.ai**
- Reaching out to Support Bot that resides within the Platform under the name of **Help**.

**When should we reach out to Haptik Support?**
Facing any type of problem with the platform.

Support Bot captures every detail of the issue along with the severity.

## Severity & Response Time

Technical support is provided for the Haptik Service offering during the subscription period and is not available as a separate offering.

## Uptime

We guarantee that 99.9% of the time the Covered Service will successfully receive and respond to API requests on the production environment.

The following definitions apply to the SLA:

- **"Covered Service"** means Haptik's end user chat experience. Conversation Studio, Analytics and other development tools are not covered under this SLA.
- **"Downtime"** means more than a 5% Error Rate. Downtime is measured based on server side Error Rate.
- **"Downtime Period"** means a period of one or more consecutive minutes of Downtime. Partial minutes or Intermittent Downtime for a period of less than one minute will not be counted towards any Downtime Periods.
- **"Error Rate"** means the number of Valid Requests that result in a response with HTTP Status 500 and Code "Internal Error" divided by the total number of Valid Requests during that period.
- **"Monthly Uptime Percentage"** means total number of minutes in a month, minus the number of minutes of Downtime suffered from all Downtime Periods in a month, divided by the total number of minutes in a month.
- **"Valid Requests"** are requests that conform to the Documentation, and that would normally result in a non-error response.

## SLA Exclusions

1. Factors outside our reasonable control (for example, natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, riots, government action, or a network or device failure external to our data centers, including at your site or between your site and our data center);
