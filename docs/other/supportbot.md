Haptik Platform has multiple tools like Conversation Studio, Smart Agent Chat, Intelligent Analytics, and Admin Tools. All of these tools have numerous features that help us create complex and sophisticated Conversational AI solutions like IVA.

But what if you get stuck somewhere or you want to know about a particular feature in more depth. To handle these, we have a **Help Section** in place to help you. 

## Where can you access **Help**?

You can access the Help Section from all tool pages, i.e. from Home Page, Conversation Studio, Smart Agent Chat, Intelligent Analytics, and Admin Tools on the left sidebar.

The Help Section is powered by an IVA trained on 200+ plus FAQs about the platform and documentation links. 

If the FAQ and documentation are not at par in resolving your query, you can also raise an issue on the IVA by following the ticketing journey.

Our support team looks at these tickets and resolves the query as soon as possible.

## How to use the Help Section?

As stated above, along with the FAQs and documentation there is a ticketing journey to raise issues about the platform. 

You can also submit requests for any new feature required on the platform. 

### 1. Have an issue

When you have an issue and you want to raise an issue you will have to provide the following information - 

- **Issue details**: You can describe the issue you are currently facing on the platform

- **Severity of the issue**: You can describe the severity/impact caused by the issue

  - There are 4 levels of severity: 
  
    - **Blocker:** indicates the issue has caused severe impact on the functioning
    
        Example - Chats not getting assigned to agents.
        
    - **High:** indicates that the issue has caused major impact on the functioning
    
        Example - Bot is not getting transferred to production
        
    - **Medium:** - indicates the issue has cause a minor impact on the the functioning
    
        Example - Business changes are not reflecting on the bot
        
    - **Low:** - indicates the issue exists but does not disrupt the functioning
    
        Example - Wrong entity is getting detected
