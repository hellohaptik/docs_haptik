Shopify is now the leading commerce platform designed for businesses of all sizes. Shopify allows businesses to create their own stores online whether they are selling physical products, digital products, handing out rentals, and so on. Shopify provides the entire setup required for any online store.

You can integrate Haptik's Intelligent Virtual Assitant (IVA) onto the Shopify website which will help you enhance the customer experience.

`Intelligent Virtual Assistant (IVA) is termed as bot throughout the document henceforth.`

Haptik's bot will help the users track their order, cancel their order, place a return for their order and also raise a concern. Haptik's IVA is completely equipped to securely manage the data which Shopify will provide in order for the users to engage with the bot.

Let's start by setting up the environment to host the Haptik bot on your Shopify website.
