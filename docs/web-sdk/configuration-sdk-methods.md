## Client Accessible SDK

The SDK upon loading exposes a Javascript SDK that can then be used to programmatically control some of the behaviour of the SDK.

## Event Listener

In order for these methods to be accessible, the SDK needs to load first. The SDK emits a custom event to notify any/all subscribers that it has loaded.

```js
    document.addEventListener('haptik_sdk', function() { 
    	// HaptikSDK is available now
      HaptikSDK.init(...); 
    });
```

Note: Using other listeners like `window.onload` or `document.onload` will lead to inconsistent behaviour as the Haptik SDK might not have been initialised yet.

- `message <String>`
*The message that's sent if the user taps on the bot prompt.*

### `launchTask(taskId, callback)`

**Params:**

- `taskId <Number>`
*The task id is specified in the tasks section of the bot builder (business manager)*
- `callback <Function>`  _`(optional)`_
*The callback executes once the call completes. The callback function is executed with `success` boolean flag as a parameter indicating whether the call completed or failed.*
