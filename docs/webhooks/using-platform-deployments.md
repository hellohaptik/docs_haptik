## Integrating using Platform Deployments
You can easily set up webhooks for your bot by using the platform deployments page inside Business Manager of the Bot Builder tool.

The platform deployments page provides a graphical interface to configure these settings.

You can learn about how to use the platform deployments page [here](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/platforms-deployment#deploying-to-webhook).
