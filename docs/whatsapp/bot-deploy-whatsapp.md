title: Deploy Bot to WhatsApp
---

You can use the `Platform Settings` section of the Conversation Studio tool to deploy your bot on Whatsapp. You can read more about the section [here](https://docs.haptik.ai/bot-builder/basic/platforms-deployment).

#### Connecting through Platform Deployments

After the bot is built you can connect it to the Whatsapp number through the **Platform Deployments** section of the Conversation Studio tool.

As a registered partner, Haptik will raise a WhatsApp container and provide all the credentials required to complete the setup.

After saving the credentials the bot should work on the connected WhatsApp number.

> Platform Deployment settings should be provided on Production environment.
