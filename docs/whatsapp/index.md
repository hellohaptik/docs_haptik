WhatsApp helps more than 1.5 billion people connect and share with the people they care about. WhatsApp is a simple, secure, and reliable way for businesses to reach their customers all over the world.

The WhatsApp Business API Client supports a subset of the features provided by the WhatsApp applications you already know from Android, iOS, Web and other platforms including end-to-end encryption. The difference is that this application can be deployed on a server, providing a local API that allows you to programmatically send and receive messages and integrate this workflow with your own systems (CRMs, customer care, etc.).

If you would like us to consider your business for inclusion in the limited public preview of the WhatsApp Business API, please visit [**here**](https://www.facebook.com/business/m/whatsapp/business-api).

> If you use anything other than the official WhatsApp Business API or other official WhatsApp tools, Whatsapp reserves the right to limit or remove your access from WhatsApp as this violates their policies.

## Prerequisites for WhatsApp Integration  

- A **Facebook Business Manager** account
- A **verified** business
- A **WhatsApp Business Account**
- A **Line of Credit** for your WhatsApp Business Account — You can refer to [**About WhatsApp Business API Billing**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2225184664363779?id=2129163877102343) for more information about the billing process as well.
- A **command line tool** such as **terminal** or an app like **Postman** that can perform **cURL requests**.

> After verifying your business, your business will be reviewed for compliance with the WhatsApp Terms of Service and WhatsApp Commerce Policy. This step is initiated automatically.

## Setup WhatsApp Business Account

Now that you know the pre-requisites for setting up a WhatsApp bot, you can set up the WhatsApp Business Account.

The first step for businesses to communicate with customers on WhatsApp is to create a [**WhatsApp Business Account**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2087193751603668) and set up a [**line of credit**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1684730811624773?id=2129163877102343). 

This business account will allow people to easily identify your business and find out more information such as your **address**, **hours of operation**, **website**, and **description**. 

Through your account, in the **Facebook Business Manager**, you will have the ability to **create message templates** for sending **notifications** to customers at scale.

We have covered the entrire setting up process, [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/whatsapp/setup-wa).

## WhatsApp Conversation

There are **two** types of conversations that are possible on WhatsApp. 

1. A regular user initiated conversation where the user sends a message to the WhatsApp bot and the bot replies back to the user. The bot is allowed to reply back to the user within a **24 hour window** from the last message sent by the user.
2. A conversational flow is bot initiated conversations. In this type whenever a transactional event occurs for eg: user bought a movie ticket, an ebill has been generated etc. **a pre approved template** message can be sent out.

### WhatsApp Bot Conversations

On WhatsApp, users can get their queries resolved with the help of AI powered conversational journeys. The conversational journeys are present for users 24 * 7 and helps user resolve their queries within minutes.

To build the conversational flows, read [**here**](https://docs.haptik.ai/whatsapp/cs-wa).

### Highly Structured Message (HSM)

WhatsApp [**message templates**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/messages/message-templates) and [**media message templates**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/messages/message-templates/media-message-templates) are specific message formats that businesses use to send out notifications or customer care messages to people that have opted into notifications. 

Messages can include appointment reminders, shipping information, issue resolution, and payment updates. These are the preferred methods of reaching customers.

Other types of messages such as [**text**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/messages/text) and [**media**](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/messages/media), must be sent within a 24-hour window of a message received from a customer.

WhatsApp Business API provides the following features:

* **Industry Information** - People can now easily identify your business by its category or industry and find out more information (i.e., hours of operation, website, location, description).
* **Send and Receive** - Enable two-way high value conversations with customers.
* **Message Templates** - Create message formats that are needed for sending notifications to users.

Templates are also known as **HSMs**. HSM stands for **Highly Structured Message**. A HSM template will have placeholders in it which can be filled with dynamic user specific values. Here’s a sample **HSM**:

`Hi {{1}}! Thanks for starting your personal training plan. We’ll send you a {{2}} update with your new schedule. You can log-in online using your training ID {{3}}. Stay fit!`

After filling in user specific data the HSM will be sent out as:

`Hi Joey! Thanks for starting your personal training plan. We’ll send you a weekly update with your new schedule. You can log-in online using your training ID 123456. Stay fit!`

## Share WhatsApp Bot

If you want to share the WhatsApp IVA chat link on website (or marketing content) wherein the user clicks on it, and it directly opens the whatsapp conversation with the IVA on their device - 
On the website, you can add a link with your WhatsApp number (e.g. 1XXXXXXXXXX) and the default text as query parameter (e.g. I'm intereseted in your car sale) as follows:

`https://wa.me/1XXXXXXXXXX?text=I'm%20interested%20in%20your%20car%20for%20sale`
