### OKRs

Objective and Key Results is a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes. The goal of OKRs is to connect company, team and personal objectives in a hierarchical way to **measurable** results, making all employees work together in one unified direction. 

A good resource to read more about OKRs is [here](https://weekdone.com/resources/objectives-key-results).

### Format

We have a company wide OKR for each quater and based on different teams define their OKRs. The CTO and Director of Product and Engineering will work with the leads of every team to define the OKR based on company OKRs. Once the OKRs are defined, understood and agreed upon the leads are responsible for communicating with the team and periodic review to make sure we are on track. 

### Quarterly OKRs

*Note: right now OKRs are set for the company and engineering teams*
