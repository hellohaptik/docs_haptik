### Our Values

Haptik's three values are Honesty, Ownership and Perseverance.

### About our Values

Our values are set of core principles that tie everyone in the company together. Our values should give guidelines on how to behave and must be actionable. They help us describe the type of behavior that we expect from people we hire. They help us to know how to behave in the organization and what to expect from others. Values are a framework for distributed decision making, they allow you to determine what to do without asking your manager. (*taken from gitlab*)
