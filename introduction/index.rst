Welcome to the Bot Builder Tool!
--------------------------------

Welcome to Haptik's bot builder tool! Once you've mastered this software, you'll be able to build chatbots with minimal coding. To get you started, we've put together some materials that will guide you through the process of building a bot on Mogambo. Depending on your learning preference, you can pick and choose from the following forms of documentation:

* **Written Instructions**: We've detailed out the process of creating bots step-by-step, all the way from chatflow design to bot deployment. Keep reading for more. 

* **Video Tutorials**: Find videos outlining a full bot creation flow and some of the more complicated features in the bot builder tool, [here].

* **Tool Tips**: For those of you who want to jump right into building your bot, we've built tooltips directly into the tool. By hovering over the tooltip icon, which are indicated by the question marks in circles, you'll be able to view brief descriptions of how to use most of the major tools in the builder tool. Next to many of the tool tip icons you'll also find a documentation icon. As you're working in the bot builder graph, you can click these icons to link to the relevant section of this documentation. 

* **Glossary**: A glossary of all the terms you might encounter over the course of building a bot. Find this here: <http://haptik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/glossary.html>

* **Design Tips**: Creating the conversation flow your bots will use might seem straightforward, but there are a few things bot designers can do to increase how engaged users feel as they interact with bots. Read through the Haptik designers' pro tips at <http://haptik-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/design-tips.html>.
